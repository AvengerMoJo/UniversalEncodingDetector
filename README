Universal Encoding Detector is a library and tools to help detect different
encoding in any char steam possible. It use directfb project interface arch
as base and build different modules and plugins for different encoding 
detection methods. Which also allow different user specific encoding detection
to hard code specific way of how encoding being detected.
Our goal is to reduce application work load to detect unknown encoding in 
different condition, provide good guess and user customized encoding specific for 
applications to use. Since it is build as libraray with plugins, model and interfaces
in mind, it is possible to be used from different languages.
